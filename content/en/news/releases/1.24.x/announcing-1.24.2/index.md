## Changes

- **Added** the `DAC_OVERRIDE` capability to the `istio-cni-node` DaemonSet. This fixes issues when running in environments
where certain files are owned by non-root users.
Note: prior to Istio 1.24, the `istio-cni-node` ran as `privileged`. Istio 1.24 removed this, but removed some required
privileges which are now added back. Relatively to Istio 1.23, `istio-cni-node` still has fewer privileges than it does with this change.

- **Fixed** Helm render to properly apply annotations on pilot `serviceAccount`
  ([Issue #51289](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/51289))

- **Fixed** an issue where istiod did not handle RequestAuthentication correctly for cross-namespace waypoint proxies  ([Issue #54051](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54051))

- **Fixed** non-default revisions controlling gateways lacking istio.io/rev labels.
  ([Issue #54280](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54280))

- **Fixed** an issue causing `ExternalName` services failing to resolve when using Ambient mode and DNS proxying.

- **Fixed** an issue preventing the PodDisruptionBudget `maxUnavailable` field from being customizable.
  ([Issue #54087](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54087))

- **Fixed** Injection config errors were being silenced (i.e. logged and not returned) when the sidecar injector was unable to process the sidecar config. This change will now propagate the error to the user instead of continuing to process a faulty config.  ([Issue #53357](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53357))
